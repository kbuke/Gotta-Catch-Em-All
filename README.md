# POKEMON TCG
This web application showcases the original 151 Pokemon, ranging from Bulbasur to Mew.
All Pokemon are put in the form of a Pokemon Card. All cards are face down showing the back of the card, an image I got from the link: 
All Pokemon names, images, id numbers, and class have been taken from the public API:

The web application is interactive, if a user hovers over a card the card face will show with name, image and id number, remove the cursour from the card and it will revert to back to the back of the card.
There are also two filter options that allow the user to see Pokemon based on either their type, or their name.
